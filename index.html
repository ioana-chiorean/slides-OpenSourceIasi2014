            Have them set their Own Metrics
            “Managers should ask employees to come up with specific metrics, which will hit targets to drive results. If you empower employees to be in the driver’s seat and make decisions that affect their success, then they are more likely to be ambitious and set stretch goals that push their limits. When employees feel like they are in control and have management support, they are likely to be engaged and hit targets based on specific metrics."
                 “I'll sit down with my direct reports and say, what are the things that we should be measuring to ensure that we're on track to hit our goals?"
                 "If you hire great people and you have a strong culture where people believe in the vision of the company and feel like they have the empowerment to help the company achieve that vision, actually people will likely set targets that are too high because they're ambitious and they want to succeed."
